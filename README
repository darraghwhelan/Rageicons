------Rageicons smiley theme for Pidgin and iChat------
-------------------------------------------------------

Based on the work done by edgesmash.

We liked edgesmash theme pack alot. But we found adding and updating faces to be a pain. 
With everyone always having to download the latest zip file and copy it over.
So we put them in a git repo and making sure everyone has the latest version is simples. Just Pull.

See branches pidgin and iChat for the goodies.


Pidgin Install

Windows:
We recomend this way because it is very simple and easy to do.
1. Install Tortoisegit  (http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/)
2. Navigate to     C:\Program Files (x86)\Pidgin\pixmaps\pidgin\emotes\           (64bit) 
			or     C:\Program Files\Pidgin\pixmaps\pidgin\emotes\                 (32bit)
			or where ever you have installed pidgin
3. Right click and click "Git Clone". Enter the url as: git://github.com/darraghwhelan/Rageicons.git  . Click OK.
4. Now this has checked out the master branch. We don't want that. So, enter into the new folder that has been create. Right click again.
   Select "Switch/Checkout" under the tortoisegit menue. Now select pidgin in the branches drop down list. Click OK.
5. You should now have the whole rageicons pack. Open pidgin and go to Tools > Preferences > Themes. Now select Rageicons.



Mac - iChat:

1. Install git.
2. Open Terminal 
3. git clone git@github.com:darraghwhelan/Rageicons ~/Rageicons
4. cd ~/Rageicons
5. git checkout pidgin
6. sudo perl install.pl
7. Restart iChat


We need to use sudo as the iChat folder where icons are stored is protected.
